# SECURE MEDICAL DATA TRANSMISSION MODEL FOR IOT BASED HEALTH-CARE SYSTEMS

Due to the significant advancement of the Internet of Things (IOT) in the health-care sector,
the security, and the integrity of the medical data became big challenges for health-care
services applications. This project proposes a hybrid security model for securing the diagnostic
text data in medical images. The proposed model is developed through integrating either 2-D discrete wavelet transform 1 level(2D-DWT-1L), 2-D discrete wavelet transform 2 level (2D-
DWT-2L) and 2-D discrete wavelet transform 3 level(2D-DWT-3L) steganography techniques with a proposed hybrid encryption scheme.

The proposed hybrid encryption schema is built using a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard, and Rivest, Shamir,
and Adleman algorithms. The proposed model starts by encrypting the secret data; then it
hides the result in a cover image using 2D-DWT-1L, 2D-DWT-2L, 2D-DWT-3L. Both
colour and grey-scale images are used as cover images to conceal different text sizes.
Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model proved its ability to hide the
confidential patient data into a transmitted cover image with high imperceptibility, capacity,
and minimal deterioration in the received stego-image.
